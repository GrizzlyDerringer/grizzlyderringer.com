  <h3>Thank You!!</h3>
  <p>Wow! The show last night at Jimmy's Place was killer. We had a ton of fun and will definitely be back. Thanks to the always amazing Mother Echo for bringing the heat. One of my favorite shows of theirs I've seen so far. And finally thanks to MONDO ZOMBIE for saving our butts by loaning us that gear!</p>
